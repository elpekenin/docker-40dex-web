Files used to build by website's docker container.

By no means a tutorial here.... If you want to make a copy, you'll need to add a `.env` file with your own MongoDB instance credentials and everything should work.

If you want to make changes (eg use a different database)
  1) Make your own fork
  2) Update your Dockerfile to build from it
  3) Change code as wished
